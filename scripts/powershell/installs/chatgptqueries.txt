ask chatgpt for:

I want a setup script that will
- setup a global powershell profile to use variables from \\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\SYSVOL\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\scripts\global-powershell-profiles\global-variables.ps1. This needs to be created as part of the script
- the contents of global-variables.ps1 need to be

$UpdatePath = "\\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\SYSVOL\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\scripts\variables-software-updates"

$SoftwareList = @(
    "GoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msi",    # Chrome 64-bit enterprise MSI
    "FirefoxInstaller.exe",                     # Standard Firefox installer EXE (rename for consistency)
    "NotepadPlusPlus.exe",                      # Notepad++ installer EXE (rename for consistency)
)

- I also want the setup for citrix workspace in a separate file (test and create this path if needed)

$UpdatePath = "\\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\SYSVOL\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\scripts\variables-citrix-updates"

$SoftwareList = @(
    "CitrixWorkspaceApp.exe"                    # Citrix Workspace app installer
    "VDAWorkstationSetup.exe"                   # Citrix VDA app LTSR installer
    "CitrixStoreFront-x64.exe"                  # Citrix StoreFront LTSR app installer
)

I also want some logic to handle copying and pasting the software from my repo to the sysvol location:
\\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\SYSVOL\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\scripts\automatedInstalls

and then for each server to copy the exe's only if they have the existing software installed, to:
C:\temp\
