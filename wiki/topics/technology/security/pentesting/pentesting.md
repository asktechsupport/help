### CIDR Notation
üìñCIDR is a way to tell computers how big or small a group of internet addresses is, and who can use them.

It is also more human readable - instead of 

192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

192.168.1.0/24 Is a lot easier¬†for¬†humans to interpret, and shorter to write.

### LLMNR Poisoning - Mitigation
---
To mitigate the LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) poisoning vulnerability in an Active Directory environment, you can use PowerShell to disable LLMNR across your network. Here's how:

<details>
<summary>Steps to Mitigate LLMNR Poisoning</summary>

### Steps:

1. **Check the current status of LLMNR**  
   Use the following PowerShell command to verify whether LLMNR is enabled:
   ```powershell
   Get-NetAdapterBinding -ComponentID ms_lltdio
   ```

   If LLMNR is active, proceed to disable it.

2. **Disable LLMNR via Group Policy**  
   To effectively manage this setting across the network, it is recommended to apply it via Group Policy.

   Use PowerShell to configure the necessary registry settings to disable LLMNR:

   ```powershell
   # Set LLMNR to disabled in the registry
   Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient" -Name "EnableMulticast" -Value 0
   ```

   If the `EnableMulticast` key doesn't exist, create it:

   ```powershell
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient" -Name "EnableMulticast" -PropertyType DWord -Value 0
   ```

3. **Confirm the setting**  
   Verify that LLMNR is disabled:
   ```powershell
   Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient" -Name "EnableMulticast"
   ```

4. **Deploy via Group Policy** (Optional for multiple machines)  
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client`.
   - Enable the setting **"Turn off multicast name resolution"**.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d6b00b-70d9-4f66-a31a-dccd0553b127)

   Alternatively, use PowerShell to deploy a Group Policy Object (GPO) across your domain:
> [!NOTE]
> Add the link to the powershell document.
   ```powershell
   # Create a new GPO
   New-GPO -Name "Disable LLMNR"
   
   # Configure the GPO to disable LLMNR
   Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "Disable LLMNR" -Key "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient" -ValueName "EnableMulticast" -Type DWord -Value 0

   # Link GPO to a specific Organizational Unit (OU)
   New-GPLink -Name "Disable LLMNR" -Target <e.g.>"OU=<<<Computers>>>,DC=<<<YourDomain>>>,DC=co,DC=uk"
   ```

5. **Test and Validate**  
   After applying the changes, test to ensure that LLMNR is disabled and that no LLMNR traffic is observed. You can use a network monitoring tool like Wireshark to confirm that LLMNR queries (port 5355) are no longer broadcasted.

   **Deploy via Group Policy** (Optional for multiple machines)  
   - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client`.
   - Enable the setting **"Turn off multicast name resolution"**.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d6b00b-70d9-4f66-a31a-dccd0553b127)

</details>

By disabling LLMNR, you effectively reduce the risk of exploitation via LLMNR poisoning attacks in your Active Directory environment.
> [!TIP]
> If a company must use or cannot disable LLMNR, the best course of action is to:
>
> 1Ô∏è‚É£Require Network Access Control
> 
> 2Ô∏è‚É£Require Strong user passwords (greater than 14 characters)

# Privilege Escalation
## AlwaysInstallElevated Registry PrivEsc
### *source:
TCM Windows Privilege Escalation course, "AlwaysInstallElevated Overview and Escalation"

**About**
There is a registry key that essentially allows anyone to run an MSI with full privileges. We can check this with a query and then exploit it:
**Key:** `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\AlwaysInstallElevated`

**Query (cmd)**

- [x] Tested ‚úÖ
```
reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```
Note that the "AlwaysInstallElevated" value is 1

### Active Directory - Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)


### Active Directory - Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)


### Active Directory - Azure AD Integration

### AD CS (Active Directory Certificate Services)
Key functions of AD CS
* Integration with Active Directory: AD CS integrates with Microsoft‚Äôs PKI implementation within Active Directory to facilitate the issuance of certificates for X.509-formatted documents, encryption, message signing, and authentication.
* Certificate Authority (CA): Certificates are issued by Certificate Authority (CA). CAs bind an identity to a public/private key pair, which is then utilized by applications to verify user identity.
* Private/Public Key Generation: The client generates a private key pair. The public key is included in a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) along with details like subject and template name.
* Certificate Signing Request (CSR): The CSR, which includes the public key and other details necessary for certificate generation, is sent to the Enterprise CA server.
Verification by CA Server: The Enterprise CA server verifies the client‚Äôs permissions and template settings. It ensures the client is permitted to request the certificate based on the provided template settings.
* Certificate Generation: If the client‚Äôs request is permitted, the CA generates a certificate based on the template settings. The certificate is signed with the CA‚Äôs private key.
* Certificate Issuance: The signed certificate is returned to the client, who can now use the certificate for secure communications, authentication, and other cryptographic operations.
* object identifiers (OIDs) [PKI Solutions provides a comprehensive list of the EKU OIDs offered by Microsoft](https://www.pkisolutions.com/object-identifiers-oid-in-pki/).
* ESC1 attacks: and [Read on ESC1 attacks](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/esc1-attacks) and Certipy: [certipy tool](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy)

#### AD Objects:
User Objects: enable network resource access for a user

InetOrgPerson: Simlar to a user account, used for compatibility with other directory services

Contacts: Used primarily to assign e-mail addresses to external users, Does not enable network access

Groups: Used to simplify the administration of access control

Computers: Enables auth and auditing of computer access to resources

Printers: Used to simplify the process of locating an connecting to printers

Shared folders: Enables users to search for shared folders based on properties

Certificates: A certificate on a server is like an ID card for a website. It shows that the website is legitimate and helps ensure that your information is safe when you visit it.
When you go to a website, this certificate lets your browser know that it‚Äôs talking to the real site and not an imposter. It also helps to encrypt any data you share, like passwords or credit card numbers, so that only the website can read it. In short, it‚Äôs a way to build trust and keep your online activities secure.
